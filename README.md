# Popular Movies Stage 1

## Project Overview
This project is part of the Android Developer Nanodegree on **Udacity**.

## Criteria met:

- Movies are displayed in the main layout via a grid of their corresponding movie poster thumbnails.
- UI contains an element (settings menu) to toggle the sort order of the movies by: most popular, highest rated.
- UI contains a screen for displaying the details for a selected movie.
- Movie details layout contains title, release date, movie poster, vote average, and plot synopsis.
- When a user changes the sort criteria (“most popular and highest rated”) the main view gets updated correctly.
- When a movie poster thumbnail is selected, the movie details screen is launched.
- In a background thread, app queries the /movie/popular or /movie/top_rated API for the sort criteria specified in the settings menu.
